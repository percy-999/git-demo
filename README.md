Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[32]
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, 
including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[33][34]
